<p>I am researching the visual strategies in medieval manuscripts used for communicating the content.

I would like to find out about the methods that were used for creating narratives and conveying the message in these books. I would like to see  how codices communicate to different kinds of audiences, and which forms are used for different kinds of subjects.
 
According to my observation, medieval imagery is highly engaging and contains an abundance of narratives. Manuscript books are special, because here text and image meet, and create a new object, a system - a book. I think the understanding of these visuals and the concepts behind them can benefit the contemporary graphic designers.

For my research I am look at manuscript books, and analyse them visually, considering also the context and codicological information. For understanding the meaning and context of the images, I read books and studies on the broader theoretical context and on medieval visual culture. 

Some of the main results of the research show that the visuals used and the purpose of the document were closely connected, the functionality played a key part in the design. The interplay of content, text and image reflects an interconnected, interdisciplinary conception of the world.  Most stunningly, medieval books testify for very layered story-telling, where several narratives and functions come together in the hand-written book-object.  </p>
